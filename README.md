# ~~Postguy~~ PostUI

##### Postman + SoapUI = PostUI

A Postman like program that removes the cloud syncing
but instead saves in a format similar to the way SoapUI does it,
allowing the files to be source controlled.
As well as avoiding any possible data protection issues
due to being used in a corporate environment.
